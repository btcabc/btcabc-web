In a [recent episode of the Stephan Livera podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgaTlU2pEPs), Stephan sat down with [Roy Sheinfeld](https://x.com/therealkingonly), the founder of [Breez](https://breez.technology/), to discuss the evolving landscape of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. The conversation covered the current state of Bitcoin usage, Lightning's role in enabling payments, and Breez’s approach to integrating these technologies into mainstream applications.

### The Dual Landscape of Bitcoin and Lightning

One of the core discussions revolved around the mixed signals emanating from the Bitcoin space. While some startups, like [Mutiny Wallet](https://www.mutinywallet.com/), have shuttered their doors, other companies, including Breez, continue to forge partnerships and push the boundaries of what’s possible within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Roy emphasized that Bitcoin is primarily seen as a speculative asset rather than a medium of exchange. He believes that for Bitcoin to thrive, it must be utilized as “peer-to-peer electronic cash.” If Bitcoin continues to be hoarded for trading, it could ultimately diminish in value.

According to Roy, the Lightning Network embodies Bitcoin's true potential as a currency. However, the current reality is that most Bitcoin transactions center around trading rather than commerce, leading to questions about Bitcoin's viability as a money alternative.

### Navigating Challenges in Lightning Adoption

Both Stephan and Roy acknowledged that the challenges faced by Lightning startups, such as technology limitations and the complexities of user experience, are significant. Roy pointed out that while failure is a part of any ecosystem's growth, the contributions of failed projects, like Mutiny, still play an essential role in advancing the understanding and infrastructure surrounding Lightning.

He highlighted the regulatory challenges the Bitcoin community faces, including constraints around custodial versus non-custodial solutions. Breez has positioned itself firmly within the non-custodial space, advocating for self-custodial solutions as a way to realize Bitcoin's true value.

### The Push for Self-Custodial Solutions

Roy expressed optimism about the growing trend toward self-custodial solutions within the Lightning ecosystem. He believes that Bitcoin’s value can only be fully realized when individuals take control of their own keys—a sentiment echoed by the popular mantra, “not your keys, not your coins.” This aligns with Roy’s vision of seeing Bitcoin used as a utility in everyday transactions rather than merely as a store of value.

### Lightning and Liquid Integration

A significant portion of the episode was dedicated to [Breez’s recent announcement regarding its Liquid integration](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/breez-lightning-sdk-integrating-support-for-liquid-network). [Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/), essentially a Bitcoin sidechain, offers unique characteristics like faster block times and confidential transactions, thus providing a different user experience compared to standard Bitcoin transactions.

Roy explained how Breez's nodeless implementation allows for seamless transactions in Liquid, addressing some challenges with Lightning, such as the costs associated with UTXOs. This approach allows users to transact without the complexities of channel management or opening/closing channels.

### Lightning as the Common Language

Roy introduced the compelling idea that Lightning serves as [“the common language of the Bitcoin economy.”](https://medium.com/breez-technology/lightning-is-the-common-language-of-the-bitcoin-economy-eb8515341c11) As various sub-networks and projects begin to adopt Lightning as an interoperability protocol, it creates a unified communication channel for transacting value. He likened this evolutionary process to the way English has become the dominant business language globally. Just as English facilitates international business, Lightning enables diverse applications to communicate efficiently in a financial context.

The conversation highlighted several use cases for Lightning, from gaming to fintech, and discussed how developers could leverage Breez’s SDK to easily integrate Bitcoin payment solutions into existing applications, creating a smoother user experience.

### A Vision for the Future

Wrapping up the discussion, Roy stressed the importance of enabling the movement of value as seamlessly as we move information. The integration of Bitcoin and Lightning into everyday applications presents a promising future where users can transact easily, mirroring the way they currently interact with non-blockchain payment systems.

### Conclusion

The episode provided a compelling look at the current state of Bitcoin, its potential as a functional currency, and the role of Lightning in realizing that potential.
